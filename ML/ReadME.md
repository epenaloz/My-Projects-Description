## Vertabal Column Data Set

For my Machine learning course, we are learning supervised learning methods such as K Nearest Neighbors. For this assignment, I was tasked with pre-processing the data, generating scatter plots and bar plots on the independent variables, creating a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for various metrics, and determining the lowest training error I received! My results are shown below. If you are interested in the data, you can find it here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/212/vertebral+column

## Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set
For my machine learning course, we are learning supervised learning methods. In this homework assignment, I implemented simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, pairwise interaction regression, polynomial regression, and quadratic nonlinearities. This assignment aimed to understand the change in the MSE on certain predictors/features and how it changes depending on the model or backward selection!

Here are some visualizations I created for this assignment.
