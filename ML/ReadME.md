## Vertabal Column Data Set

In this assignment, I used K Nearest Neighbors, an ML algorithm for supervised learning.  For this assignment, I pre-processed the data, generated scatter plots and bar plots on the independent variables, created a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for various metrics, and determined the lowest training error I received! My results are shown below. If you are interested in the data, you can find it here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/212/vertebral+column

## Combined Cycle Power Plant Data Set
In this homework assignment, I implemented simple linear regression, multiple linear regression, pairwise interaction regression, polynomial regression, and quadratic nonlinearities. This assignment aimed to understand the change in the MSE on certain predictors/features and how it changes depending on the model or backward selection!

Grade: A

Here are some visualizations I created for this assignment.

## Time Series Classification:

Grade Part 1:



Grade Part 2:



In this assignment, I am tasked to do classification on time series data. The data used in this assignment can be found in the link below.
I do feature extraction on this dataset, focusing on time-domain features. Then, estimate std and confidence intervals using Bootstrap.

Data: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Activity+Recognition+system+based+on+Multisensor+data+fusion+\%28AReM\%29

I extract time domain features like the minimum, maximum, mean, median, etc for all 6 time series.

Using Bootstrap, I generate an interval for the standard deviation of each feature.
