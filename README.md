# My-Projects-Description
In this public repository, I will describe my coding projects! These projects are projects I have completed during my undergraduate years at CSULA and graduate years at USC.




NOTE: No code will be publicly shown, only descriptions of the assingments/implementations I did. 

Each folder contains a readME.md that will contain the project/assignment descriptions!

#### The DataScience folder. 
This folder will include any data analysis or data science projects from courses I have taken at USC, such as Programming for Data Science and Data Science at Scale, or in personal cases. 

#### The MachineLearning folder. 
This folder contains  descriptions of assignments I have learned in my Machine Learning Course.
Some topics include KNN, KNN regression, Linear Regression, Multiple Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Logistic Regression, test and train MSEs, Bootstrap, NN, Confidence Intervals, Time Series Classification, and more.

#### The DataMining folder
This folder will contain descriptions of assignments I have completed in my Data Mining course. Topics include finding frequent itemsets of a market-based model, collaborative filtering recommendation systems, Apirori, SON Algorithm, Locality Sensitive Hashing, Hybrid recommendation Systems, Girvan Newman algorithm to detect communities in graphs, Bloom Filtering, Fixed Size Sampling, Flajolet-Martin Algorithm, Data Streaming, and Clustering.
