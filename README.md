# My-Projects-Description
In this public repository, I will describe my coding projects! These projects are projects I have completed during my undergraduate years at CSULA and graduate years at USC.


## Analysis of Meteorite Landings
This final course project required me to analyze a data set and generate visualizations to do analysis. I levergeaed python libraries such as matplotlib, matplotlib.pypplot, seaborn, and plotly.express!

Course: Introduction to Programming for Data Informatics

Grade: A

* Analyzed a csv file containing 46,000 Meteorite landings data up until 2016
* Coded in Python leveraging pandas and other libraries to clean, create visualizations, and assess data

## Pixstory Analysis
I worked in a team to analyze a dataset consisting of 95k rows, and 27 columns, in which our team add 17 of those columns from outside sources to gather more insights about the data.
Pixstory is a social media app in where its mission is to maintain a "clean" and "truthful" platform for its users. 
Our team used python to analyze the, location of users within the platform, language detection using Tika Lang Detection, Language Translation, grouping similar images togther, Hate speech and term analysis, events, popular topics, and toxicity within the platform. A majority of my work was in determing hate speech / hate terms within the social media narratives. I generated a visualization using D3!

Course: Data Science at Scale

Grade: A

## Analysis of E-Commerce Data
* Analyzed data from a csv file containing 190,000 lines of E-commerce data imported from Kaggle
* Coded in Python to retrieve a total number of unique items, customers, and country. Obtained the average number of
unique items per invoice, average transaction per invoice, and total number of purchases for each item

## Analysis of Qualtrics Comments Per Provider
In my current role as a Data Management Specialist, I created a code that would gather the comments from qualtrics, and look for specific providers within the comments, and generate a PDF as a result. This process used to be done manually however this code saved us a
lot of time!

## Vertabal Column Data Set

For my Machine learning course, we are learning supervised learning methods such as K Nearest Neighbors. For this assignment I was tasked to pre-process the data, generate scatter plots and bar plots on the independent variables, create a K Nearest Neighbors algorithm for a variety of metrics and determine the lowest training error I received! My results are shown below. If you are interested in the data you can find it here: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/212/vertebral+column
