In this folder, I will show projects completed in my courses at USC, like Programming for Data Science or Data Science at Scale.

## Analysis of Meteorite Landings
This final course project required me to analyze a data set and generate visualizations to do analysis. I leveraged python libraries such as matplotlib, matplotlib.pypplot, seaborn, and plotly.express!

Course: Introduction to Programming for Data Informatics

Grade: A

* Analyzed a CSV file containing 46,000 Meteorite landings data up until 2016
* Coded in Python, leveraging pandas and other libraries to clean, create visualizations, and assess data

## Pixstory Analysis
I worked in a team to analyze a dataset consisting of 95k rows and 27 columns, in which our team added 17 of those columns from outside sources to gather more insights about the data.
Pixstory is a social media app whose mission is to maintain a "clean" and "truthful" platform for its users. 
Our team used Python to analyze users' location, language detection using Tika Lang Detection, Language Translation, grouping similar images together, Hate speech and term analysis, events, popular topics, and toxicity within the platform. Most of my work was determining hate speech/hate terms within the social media narratives. I generated a visualization using D3!

Course: Data Science at Scale

Grade: A

## Analysis of E-Commerce Data
* Analyzed data from a CSV file containing 190,000 lines of E-commerce data imported from Kaggle
* Coded in Python to retrieve a total number of unique items, customers, and countries. Obtained the average number of
unique items per invoice, average transaction per invoice, and total number of purchases for each item

## Analysis of Qualtrics Comments Per Provider
In my current role as a Data Management Specialist, I created a code that would gather the comments from Qualtrics, look for specific providers within the comments, and generate a PDF as a result. This process used to be done manually however, this code saved us a
a lot of time!
